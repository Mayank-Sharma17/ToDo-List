# dome

**dome** is a web application that serves as a task manager. This app features two distinct lists: one for tasks scheduled for the current day and another for tasks that recur daily. However, it's important to note that this application is limited in its functionality. Users can create tasks and view them but do not have the capability to modify or remove tasks. This limitation arises because the app does not utilize a database for storing task data.

> **Note :** More features will be added soon.
